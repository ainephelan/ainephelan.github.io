Hello! I'm Áine. I do data science. I'm working mostly in Python and SQL. I enjoy learning and the more I learn, the more I build, the more I enjoy building.

What I like about data is how it touches *everything*; it is applicable in every field. Instead of a profession narrowing your horizons to some few, discrete, specific areas, data opens the world right up to you. 

Also I just really dig the analysis of it all. When you get your Keyser Söze moments, when the puzzle pieces all slot into place, I mean, is there anything more satisfying?

So that's me and data. Other things I care about: gender disparity, mental health and waste.  

In my spare time, *LOL*, just kidding, who has any of that?  

I aspire to have spare time to watch films, run, read, hike, watch live music and talk at length to interesting people about interesting things.  

That's it from me. Remember, be excellent to each other!
