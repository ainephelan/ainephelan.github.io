Hello. I'm Áine and I do data science and analytics. I mostly work in Python and SQL, and whatever else I need along the way to help me get done what I'm trying to do.

Data was an easy sell for me. My analytical skills are far and away my favourite to use, followed by my curiosity, a love of communication and an impulse towards excellence. I couple these skills with deep interests in human behaviour, storytelling and business.

This is what data science is to me - the meeting of analysis and excellence and curiosity and business and behaviour and storytelling, with boundless potential. It touches everything. You have an interest? Go forth and explore it. A skill you wish to develop? Right this way ma'am!

So that's me. 

I'll be using this site to share some things I've worked on, and to make myself be better at what I do along the way. 

Come check out the links below and connect with me!
