Hello! I'm Áine. I do data science. I'm working mostly in Python and SQL, and really enjoy learning and building.  

What I like about data is how it is everywhere and it touches *everything*; not only is it applicable in literally every field there is, but it's available to you in some form for that field, so in that way it opens up the world to you. And it's only becoming more so. 

Also I really dig the analysis of it all. When you get your Keyser Söze moment, when all the puzzle pieces slot into place, oh boy, I mean, is there anything more satisfying?

Other things I care about: gender disparity, mental health and waste.  

In my spare time, *LOL*, just kidding, who has any of that?  

I aspire to have spare time to watch films, run, read, hike, watch live music and talk at length to interesting people about interesting things.  

Remember, be excellent to each other!
