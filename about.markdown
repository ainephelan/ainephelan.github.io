Hello, I'm √Åine and I do data science. I work in Python and SQL, incorporating all the miscellaneous nuggety, hacky bits of wisdom I pick up along the way.

Data science was an easy sell for me. My analytical skills are far and away my favourite to use, followed by communication, curiosity and an impulse towards excellence. I couple this with a passionate interest in human behaviour, storytelling and business.

This is what data science is to me - the meeting of analysis and excellence and curiosity and business and behaviour and storytelling, with boundless potential. It touches everything. You have an interest? Go forth and explore it. A skill you wish to develop? Right this way ma'am.

So that's me. 

I'll be using this site to share some things I've worked on, and to make myself be better at what I do along the way.
