![Hi](aine_profile_pic.jpeg)

Hello! I'm √Åine. I do data science. I'm working mostly in Python and SQL, and really enjoy learning and building.  

What I like about data is how it is everywhere and touches everything; it's applicable in every field there is! And working with it has made me *so* interested in the world around me.  

Other things I care about: gender disparity, mental health and waste.  

In my spare time, *LOL*, just kidding, who has any of that?  

I aspire to have spare time to watch films, run, read, hike, watch live music and talk at length to interesting people about interesting things.  

Remember, be excellent to each other!
