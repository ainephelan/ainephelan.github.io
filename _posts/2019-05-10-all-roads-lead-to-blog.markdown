So, why a blog? I wouldn’t have thought it of me either, but frankly, the universe seems to be converging on a single point when it comes to this. Who am I to argue with the universe?

### Journaling
A friend bought me a goal-tracking journal. I started using it (a year later, but moving on) and… I liked it. I found it valuable; small moments of structured reflection and planning in the morning and at night, the flow of my own thoughts, bookending my day.

## Articles are everywhere
I read consistently for personal development now, an article or two most days having something to do with learning, productivity, creativity, mental health, data science, or all of the above. Medium has a lot to answer for.

For the most part the articles are interesting *and* applicable. The topics resonate with me. I easily relate them to my own life. And it is noteable to me that the act itself doesn’t feel like a chore – it’s not taxing or draining in the way active learning can be. I find it calming, even.

I must be primed for it, because writing is one topic I come across again and again without actively searching – writing to clear your mind and combat anxiety, for creativity, productivity, to bolster your own learning, to boost your profile. Those machine learning algorithms may be doing their thing in my feed, but they’re not wrong – I’m pretty happy with what they’re serving up.

## Data Science
I’ve been teaching myself Data Science for a few months now. The internet is chock full of resources which allow you to do so and has been my ally and closest companion on this lonely road. 

But, how do you break into a new field? How do you share the work you’ve done, and get your projects and insights out before the eyes of the world? How do you showcase that not only have you got the technical chops, but you’re a pretty legendary communicator too? The Internet: “Blog”. Industry friend: “Blog”.

Blog it is then.
