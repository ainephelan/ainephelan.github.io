## Visualising the Gender Gap in College Majors  
Today we're going to look at creating visualisations which communicate the historical narrative of the gender gap in different fields of study in the US.

We'll use the already cleaned data set described below, and we're going to take the opportunity to practice some techniques to eliminate [chartjunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartjunk) and maximise the [data-ink ratio](https://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Data-Ink_Ratio).  All the better to see you with my dear!


### Context
The [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/current_tables.asp) in the US releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women since 1970. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.

[Randal Olson](http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/14/percentage-of-bachelors-degrees-conferred-to-women-by-major-1970-2012/), a data scientist from the University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set for years 1970 to 2012 and made it available on his personal website. 

Gender parity is a topic close to my own heart, and at least here in Australia, it appears we still have [a long way to go](https://blog.csiro.au/where-are-all-the-women-in-stem/) in [bridging the gap](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/women-leave-stem-over-pay-gap-study-finds).

News articles aside, let's use Randal's [cleaned data](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv) to see some historical differences between the genders regarding their chosen fields of study in the US.

Note, due to the nature of the historical data available to us, for the purposes of this analysis we will be treating gender as a binary construct only.

## Load the Data
Let's load our data and do some initial exploration of our data set.

It is not large and we can easily display it in its entirety.

```
import pandas as pd

women_degrees = pd.read_csv('percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv')
women_degrees
```
